# camera-streamer-unraid
An unraid template to deploy [camera-streamer](https://github.com/ayufan/camera-streamer) on to UNRAID.
I have been using camera-streamer to connect with a USB camera to create an IP cam, to AgentDVR.
Of all the other "streamers" like ustreamer, mjpegstreamer or local device on AgentDVR I was impressed
with the performance and stability of camera-streamer.
